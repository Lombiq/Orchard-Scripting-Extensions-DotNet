# Orchard Scripting Extensions: .NET (C#, VB) Readme



## Project Description

A child module for Orchard Scripting Extensions for running C# and Visual Basic code inside Orchard.


## Documentation

**This module depends on [Orchard Scripting Extensions](https://github.com/Lombiq/Orchard-Scripting-Extensions) and uses many of its features. Please install it first!**  
(And also read that module's docs to see what you can do with it - and through it, with .NET scripting).

The module's source is available in two public source repositories, automatically mirrored in both directions with [Git-hg Mirror](https://githgmirror.com):

- [https://bitbucket.org/Lombiq/orchard-scripting-extensions-dotnet](https://bitbucket.org/Lombiq/orchard-scripting-extensions-dotnet) (Mercurial repository)
- [https://github.com/Lombiq/Orchard-Scripting-Extensions-DotNet](https://github.com/Lombiq/Orchard-Scripting-Extensions-DotNet) (Git repository)

Bug reports, feature requests and comments are warmly welcome, **please do so via GitHub**.
Feel free to send pull requests too, no matter which source repository you choose for this purpose.
